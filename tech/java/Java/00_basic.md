## 基础概念
#### Jar vs War
* JAR Java Archive
* War Java Web Applcation Archive
both of them are archive file, War can run directly while most of time, Jar only some class archive.

but, for Springboot, the Jar generate by Springboot is “fat Jar” which contain a embedded tomcat inside it, so it can also run directly while War need a outside Tomcat, so if you want to deply only one application, use Jar, if need more than one application, War would be better.
